### What did you do this past week?

This week we went over range iterators in more depth and took our first test. 

### What's in your way?

The next week I have a major test and projects to work on in each of my classes. Additionally, I am busy interviewing with multiple companies and working on a research paper.

### What will you do next week?

I will study for my test, make progress on projects, and continue preparing for interviews. My goal is to manage my time such that I get closer to my objectives in each of these areas. 

### What's my experience of the class?

The first exam was interesting because of the format. Some of the multiple choice questions tripped me up, but I found the coding portion very doable. For the next test, I plan to study the reading materials more closely. Studying for the midterm somewhat changed my perspective on the material. It is hard to realize how large the aggregate total of our learning is until you realize how much the little features we learn add up. For an easy to use language, Python has a significant depth of complexity. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick-of-the-week is Spectacle. This app makes it easy to move around windows on  Mac. I use it every time I am on my computer and find it particularly useful for programming. You can shift windows to the up, down, left, right, and into fully filling the screen. This will help you save time and think more clearly.
