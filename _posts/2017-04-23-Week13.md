### What did you do this past week?

We went deeper into our study of inheritance and the relationship between parent and children objects. Specifically, we covered the various ways virtual methods and extended methods interact.

### What's in your way?

I have an extremely important exam in my Applied Linear Algebra class as well as multiple projects and an exam next week. I am trying to finish out these last two weeks of the semester strong. 

### What will you do next week?

This week, I will study for my exam and work begin working on my projects due next week.

### What's my experience of the class?

The class has grown increasingly complex while maintaining pragmatic content. Professor Downing gave an interesting example just this past week of a time during his career where the exact concept we were covering affected his software. As a senior, I enjoy the part of the class devoted to practical concepts because I am drawing closer towards that environment.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My tip-of-the-week is work with partners on projects. I hadn't done it for our previous projects and am doing it for our final one. We are already much further ahead on the project than I would be if it was just me working on it. Working with a partner prevents procrastination and makes the work go more quickly.
